# Rootara

A Self-Hosted Family Genetic Testing Results Analysis Platform.

[中文文档](README.md)

## Introduction

Rootara is a self-hosted family genetic testing results analysis platform designed to help users better understand and analyze their family genetic testing results. With Rootara, users can upload genetic testing data, visualize genetic results among family members, identify potential genetic disease risks, and explore family genetic traits. Rootara recommends uploading GVCF files generated by genetic testing companies, and it also supports VCF files, as well as result files from mainstream genetic testing companies such as 23andme and Wegene.

After downloading your data, you can request the genetic testing company to permanently delete your raw sequencing data to protect your privacy. Rootara supports self-hosting, ensuring that all data is stored on your own server, guaranteeing data security and privacy protection.

## Features

### User Management

- **Administrator**: Can manage all user information, approve user registration requests, but does not have access to view regular users' genetic testing reports.
- **Regular User**: Can view their own genetic testing reports and modify their personal information.

Users can authorize other users to view their genetic testing reports and set authorization time limits or revoke access at any time.

### Tech Stack

- **PostgreSQL** database is used to store user information, genetic testing reports, authorization details, etc.
- The frontend is built using the **Next.js** framework.

### Genetic Testing Reports

Implemented functional modules include:

- Ancestry Analysis
- Nutritional Metabolism
- Genetic Diseases (based on Clinvar)
- Skin Characteristics
- Athletic Genes
- Drug Response (based on PharmGKB)
- Genetic Traits

### Custom Modules

Users can create custom modules by selecting gene loci of interest to generate personalized reports. Rootara provides a comprehensive configuration file format, allowing users to easily generate custom reports through simple configuration.
